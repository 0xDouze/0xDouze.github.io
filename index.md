# Welcome

I am Kevin Tavukciyan, currently a grad student in computer science in Paris, France.
In this blog, I'll ramble about whatever i'm working on and would like to show, or anything else really.
(ok I won't talk about cooking).

Mostly it should be about static analysis stuff that I find interesting, with possibly a hint of mathematics.

Anyway, it might be a bit empty for now, but hope you'll find my posts interesting !
